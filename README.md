# SAT vs ACT
This was my first project for General Assembly's Data Science Immersive.
<br>
I was tasked with seeking out relationships between the two large standardized tests in the US, the SAT and the ACT.<br>
The project is segmented into three sections:
- Performing basic checks of the data and ensuring it is structured correctly for analysis.
- Making changes to the dataframe for comparison
- Visualizing the data

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully the flow of the project is clear and easy to follow.
